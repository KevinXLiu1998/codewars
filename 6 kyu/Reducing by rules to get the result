// #Reducing by rules to get the result

// Your task is to reduce a list of numbers to one number.
// For this you get a list of rules, how you have to reduce the numbers.
// You have to use these rules consecutively. So when you get to the end of the list of rules, you start again at the beginning.

function reduceByRules(numbers, rules){
  return numbers.reduce((a, b, i) => rules[(i - 1) % rules.length](a, b))
