// In this Kata, we will calculate running pace. To do that, we have to know the distance and the time.

// Create the following function:

// runningPace(distance, time)

// Where: distance - An float with the number of kilometres

// time - A string containing the time it took to travel the distance. It will always be minutes:seconds. For example "25:00" means 25 minutes. You don't have to deal with hours.

// The function should return the pace, for example "4:20" means it took 4 minutes and 20 seconds to travel one kilometre.

// Note: The pace should always return only the number of minutes and seconds. You don't have to convert these into hours. Floor the number of seconds.


function runningPace(distance, time) {

  var parts = time.split(':').map(Number)
  , seconds = parts[0] * 60 + parts[1]
  ,    pace = seconds / distance | 0;
  
  return (pace / 60 | 0) + ':' + `00${pace % 60}`.slice(-2);
}
