// You walk in a maze. You need to reach the exit through many rooms. These rooms are in a straight line.

// You can only walk in the dark. Otherwise, you will be caught by the enemy.

// Your trouble is that some rooms have light bulbs. If the light bulb is bright when you enter the room. You were caught by the enemy.

// Fortunately, the status of these bulbs (on/off) is aoto-switched every minute. So you have a chance to go through the maze.

// Task
// Let's us use a string map to represent these roomsï¼Œ like this: "xo oxox".

// "x" means there is a bulb in the room, and its initial status is off;

// "o" means there is a bulb in the room, and its initial status is on;

// " "(space) means a room without bulb, it's always dark.

// Your task is to determine if you can go through the maze. Return true if you can, false otherwise.

// Note
// Your initial position is the most left, the exit position is the most right.

// Your moving speed is 1 minute per step. You can not stop before you start your moving until you reach the exit.
